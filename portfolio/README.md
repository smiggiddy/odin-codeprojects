# Portfolio Project

This is a static portfolio website built using HTML and CSS. It showcases my skills and projects.

## Viewing Locally

To view the project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:** If you haven't already, clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  **Open `index.html`:** Navigate to the project directory in your file explorer and open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

That's it! You should now be able to view the portfolio website in your browser.
